<p>Wii Fit Resolutions 2 By Thickerwasp On Deviantart Obviously anything that is high impact or has fall risks is out. Baby stopped growing at about 6wks. This is basically what I did on my Wii. Most of the workouts Ive researched for pregnant women include low impact exercises like yoga walking and light cardiovascular exercises. I will admit I had an emotional fit with my Wii Fit during month 5 of pregnancy when it yelled at me for sneaking too many snacks and kept telling me I was cheating during yoga moves and not bending down far enough. There is not one for Wii.</p>
